Submitted by: Raef Youssef

Time spent: 20-25 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] UI animations
* [x] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] User can enter tax percentage and the number of people
- [x] User has the ability to choose to exclude tax from tip and the ability to round up the payment

## Notes

- Had issues with saving string and bools as defaults. I had to account for the possibility of nils.
